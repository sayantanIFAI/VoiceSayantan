"""Matching a spoken place, police station or district against the geo_* tables (owner, 2026-10-23, item 19).

WHAT IT IS FOR. A caller gives an address, or answers "which police station?", in Bengali, Hindi or English -- and the recogniser writes it any way it heard it
("শ্যামপুকুর", "shampukur thana", "सल्ट लेक"). The tables hold the real names (geo_data.py, from the West Bengal administrative dataset); this finds which row a
spoken form belongs to, and from a row, its parents by foreign key: a place -> its police station -> its district.

WHAT IT NEVER DOES (CLAUDE.md, the truth boundary). It names no place the tables do not hold and invents no police station: a place with no station in the
dataset resolves to no station. A sound-alike is only ever a CANDIDATE (the same discipline as clinic-api/gazetteer.py); the one thing treated as settled is an
EXACT written-form match, and only when every candidate of the best match agrees on one police station. The agent stores the table's own written name, and speaks
nothing from here.
